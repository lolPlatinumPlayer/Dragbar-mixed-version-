# Dragbar-mixed-version-
All code is write by myself. I use a mixed way to develop the dragbar component. On one way, I use jq to get data from dom, And then I use these data to change vuex status in directive by js. I know its looks strange. But I think I may need it in the future. Anyway, I spend so much time in here.
